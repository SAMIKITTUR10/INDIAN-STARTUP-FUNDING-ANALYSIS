# Startup Funding Analysis

## Overview
This script processes a startup funding dataset and generates visual insights on investment trends, sector and city distributions, top-funded startups, active investors, and funding types. It also concludes with strategic recommendations for both investors and founders.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

Install missing packages using:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

## File Structure
- `README.md` — documentation
- `startup_funding.csv` — dataset (expected in the `/content/` directory)
- `analysis_script.py` — Python script

## Usage
1. Place `startup_funding.csv` in `/content/`.
2. Ensure the script has read access to this file.
3. Run the script:
python analysis_script.py

4. The script will:
- Load and clean the data.
- Convert and filter by date.
- Fill or default missing columns.
- Parse `amount_in_usd` to numeric.
- Generate and display plots:
  - Funding trends over time
  - Top 10 sectors by funding count
  - Top 10 cities by funding count
  - Top 10 startups by funding count
  - Top 10 active investors
  - Investment type distribution
- Print strategic recommendations based on insights.

## Script Breakdown

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1. Libraries | Imports `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`. |
| 2. Load Data | Reads CSV file into `df`. |
| 3. Inspect Data | Prints head and info for initial inspection. |
| 4. Clean & Preprocess | Standardizes column names, parses dates, handles missing values, and formats funding amounts as numeric. |
| 5–10. Visualizations | Generates:
- Line chart (funding trend over time)
- Bar charts for sectors, cities, startups, investors
- Countplot for investment types
| 11. Recommendations | Summarizes key insights:
- Highlight top-performing sector(s)
- Identify hotspot city/cities
- Emphasize dominant investment type
- Advise monitoring funding cycles

## Tips & Next Steps
- **Save plots**: Modify `plt.show()` to `plt.savefig('filename.png')` to preserve visuals.
- **Time granularity**: Change aggregation from monthly to weekly/quarterly as needed.
- **Deeper insights**: Explore correlations (e.g., average funding amounts by sector/city) or periodic comparisons (year-over-year).
- **Interactivity**: Consider using Plotly or Dash to make visualizations interactive.
